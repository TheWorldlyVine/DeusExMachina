# Novel Creator MVP Implementation Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation strategy for the Novel Creator MVP, focusing on the core Agentic novel generation capabilities while deferring collaboration features to a later phase. The implementation will follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices and adhere to the established monorepo patterns.

## Technical Implementation Guidelines

### Backend Services

#### Java Service Structure
```
apps/backend/novel-{service-name}/
├── src/
│   ├── main/
│   │   ├── java/
│   │   │   └── com/deusexmachina/novel/{service}/
│   │   │       ├── config/
│   │   │       ├── controller/
│   │   │       ├── service/
│   │   │       ├── repository/
│   │   │       ├── model/
│   │   │       ├── dto/
│   │   │       └── exception/

│   └── test/
│       └── java/
│           └── com/deusexmachina/novel/{service}/
└── build.gradle
```

#### Testing Approach
1. Write failing test first (Red)
2. Implement minimal code to pass (Green)
3. Refactor while keeping tests green
4. Aim for >80% coverage
5. Include both unit and integration tests

### Frontend Application

#### React App Structure
```
apps/frontend/novel-creator/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── editor/
│   │   ├── generation/
│   │   ├── memory/
│   │   └── common/
│   ├── features/
│   │   ├── document/
│   │   ├── generation/
│   │   └── memory/
│   ├── hooks/
│   ├── services/
│   ├── store/
│   ├── types/
│   └── utils/
├── tests/
│   ├── unit/
│   ├── integration/
│   └── e2e/
└── package.json
```

#### Component Development
1. Create test file first
2. Define component interface
3. Write failing tests
4. Implement component
5. Add Storybook stories
6. Document props and usage

## CI/CD Pipeline Updates

### Backend Pipeline Additions
```yaml
matrix:
  function: [auth-function, api-function, processor-function, novel-ai-service, novel-memory-service, novel-document-service]
```

### Frontend Pipeline Additions
- Add novel-creator to frontend build matrix
- Configure deployment to `/novel-creator/` path
- Add specific E2E tests for novel creator

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy
1. Create feature branches from `develop`
2. Use conventional commits
3. Create PRs with comprehensive descriptions
4. Require code reviews
5. Merge to `develop` after approval
6. Deploy to staging for testing
7. Merge to `main` for production

### Daily Development Cycle
1. **Morning**: Review todos, plan day's work
2. **Development**: Follow TDD cycle
3. **Testing**: Run full test suite
4. **Review**: Self-review code changes
5. **Commit**: Make atomic commits
6. **Evening**: Update todos, document progress
